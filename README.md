## Abstract
Game Shelf (working title) is a multiplatform mobile application developed using React Native and Expo. Similar to IMDb, Game Shelf allows users to search for and view information about video games by title, studio, genre, platform, year, or rating. Data is extracted from the RAWG Video Games Database API, one of the largest free video game databases. Users can create, edit, and view lists of games they have played or are interested in playing, with lists available offline through AsyncStorage for local storage. Game Shelf also enables users to add games to a favorites list. Search functionality and list management are powered by React Query for efficient data fetching and caching, while app navigation is handled through React Navigation. The search feature and each list can be filtered by title, studio, genre, platform, release date, and rating. Results and lists can be sorted alphabetically or numerically in ascending or descending order, with sorting and filtering operations managed by Lodash utilities to enhance performance and flexibility. Game Shelf provides gamers with a comprehensive platform to track, discover, and manage their personal video game libraries.
